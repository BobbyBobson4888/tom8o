This is a pomodoro timer I cobbled together in an hour.

By default, work periods are 25 minutes, short breaks are 5 minutes, and long breaks are 15 minutes. Every third break is long.

The benefit of this pomodoro timer is that it won't distract you once you're "in the zone." At the end of a work period, you are not notified until you check the time. This way, if you get focused, the alarm doesn't distract you automatically. This is great, but doesn't solve the problem of constantly checking the time to see if you're getting close to a break. For this reason, you can press right shift + left arrow to enable the automatic notification.

There are three keybindings:  
Right shift + up arrow, which (un)pauses the timer  
Right shift + down arrow, which prints the current time remaining to the console (negative if there is time remaining and positive if the work time is over), if the work time is over, pressing right shift + down arrow activates the break.  
Right shift + left arrow activates notification of the end of the work period.

like I said I cobbled this together in an hour so it isn't the most polished thing in the world.

I have yet to really test this in a real world scenario but i'm going to in like 3 hours so gimme a minute
